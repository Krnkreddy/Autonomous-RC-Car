## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains two Arduino-based robotics projects:

1. **🔧 Basic Bluetooth RC Car** – A manually controlled robot via Bluetooth using a smartphone app.
2. **🤖 Autonomous RC Car with Obstacle Avoidance** – An enhanced version that integrates an ultrasonic sensor for semi-autonomous behavior.

These projects were developed to explore embedded systems, wireless communication, and robotics in a practical, educational setting.

## 📄 Abstract

Bluetooth technology is transforming the way electronic devices interact, enabling real-time wireless control and automation. This project applies Bluetooth communication to remotely control an RC car, with two functional versions:

- A **basic model** offering manual control via a smartphone
- An **autonomous version** using an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and avoidance

The project integrates Arduino hardware with motor drivers and sensors to demonstrate core robotics concepts. It emphasizes learning through hands-on experimentation, contributing to areas like **STEM education**, **mobility automation**, and **wireless control systems**.

## 🎮 1. Basic Bluetooth RC Car

This version allows directional control of the car via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Commands like `F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, and `S` are sent via serial to control motor directions using the L293D driver.

### 🔧 Features
- Real-time manual control
- Compatible with Android Bluetooth controller apps
- Modular Arduino-based design
- Customizable pin configuration and speed

## 🤖 2. Autonomous RC Car with Obstacle Avoidance

This upgraded version integrates an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect and avoid obstacles automatically. It operates in hybrid mode: Bluetooth control + intelligent stopping/turning when obstacles are nearby.

### 🧠 Additional Features
- Real-time distance measurement
- Dynamic stopping or steering logic
- Enhanced interactivity and safety
- Smart movement in limited environments
